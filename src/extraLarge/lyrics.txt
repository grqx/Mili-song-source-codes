If abstraction is the definition of beauty
Are those of us chasing after clarity
A representation of ugly?


Call me mommy
Just like your fantasy
There is no crime in ideality
Mux demux
Can't you understand me?
I'm not mine NAND I'm not yours, ah


This could end right here if you don't let it out
Let it out
Give up or give me your all
Tell me now
Tell me now


If we can be completely simulated
Do we need a real reality?
Don't let words die, let love run dry
Like what we did
To the rivers we killed off in our near future, ah
And mumble some stupid stuff, ah
Like
"I saw it coming"
"Pretend it's not happening"
"Us losers do nothing so winners keep winning"

Sit, fetch your leash
Dictated economy
Show me your belly
Forgotten ecology
Stay, okay, eat
Human psychology
Good boy, here's a treat
Hungry for energy
We are searching
Following our human instincts
Looking for ghosts of the non-existing kind
Who make us whole from the very beginning
We keep chasing
Dreaming about the perfect being
Perfect parents who are non-existing
Our bodies grew, our minds stayed the same


Now, darling, where do we go from here?
Now, darling, where do we go from here?
Now, darling, where do we go from here?
Darling, darling
Hey, honey, where do we go from here?
Hey, honey, where do we go from here?
Now, darling, where do we go from here?
Now, darling, where do we go from here?
To where?

Call me daddy
Where's your "yes sir" and "please"?
That's the only vocabulary you need
Mux demux
Can't you understand me?
You turn my screen #0000ff


We could end right here if you'd just let us fall
Let us fall
No tears, no regrets
No zero-days at our fault
Hear me out
It's a perfect plan if you'd just
Shut up
Shut up
Then maybe you'll see what I've endured now
Hear me out
Li-lu-li-la, lu-la-lu-la
It's all just sunk cost, I know
But I'm not ready to stop
I don't want to stop, ah
